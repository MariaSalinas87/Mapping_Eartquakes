# Mapping_Eartquakes

The purpose of the challenge was for me to show Basil and Sadhana the relation to the tectonic plates' location on the earth, and they also wanted to see the earthquakes greater than 4.5 on a third map. Below you will find a. the tactonic plates added, b. the major earthquakes and c. the dark map.
